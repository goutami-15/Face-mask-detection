  A machine learning project using python with various packages while training the model to detect mask. 
 </p>

## 🧰 Features
1. Detects if the user is wearing a mask or not.
2. Displays realtime text.

## 🔩 Instructions
1. Install python on your system.
2. Install all the required dependencies and packages listed. 
3. Run `train.py` to train the model.
4. Run `test.py` to test if the model can classify correctly or not.

## 📚 Basic Working Principle
* Image classification is used to help create a model.
* This model is trained with a dataset of images of people with and without masks.
* Later the model is used on a test dataset to classify images on the basis of presence of mask.
* The model can be fine tuned to train on larger dataset to improve its detection accuracy.

## 🌴 Applications
- Automated detection reduces time spent in manual checking in crowded areas.
- Can be further developed into an API which can be used in other applications.
- Reduces risk of human interference since it can be monitored remotely upon improvement.
- Model becomes more accurate and faster as we continue to train it with samples.
